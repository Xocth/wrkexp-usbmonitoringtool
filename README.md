# wrkexp-usbmonitoringtool
This project was for my work experience week in college November 11-15 2024

My task is to build a Windows application to monitor and manage USB devices, ensuring that only authorized devices are connected to the organization’s machines. The tool should log all USB activity, provide detailed information about each device, and allow administrators to block specific device types or models. Additionally, the client wants the tool to work at the system level—able to monitor and block USB devices even before users log in.
